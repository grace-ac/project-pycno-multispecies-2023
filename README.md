# Project Background Information:
### Purpose
Understand if there is a difference in disease progression/ prognosis between three different sea star species when exposed to sea star wasting disease (SSWD).

### Species studied
Juvenile Sunflower Stars, _Pycnopodia helianthoides_

Ochre Stars, _Pisaster ochraceus_  

Leather Stars, _Dermasterias imbricata_     

### Hypotheses:
1. _Pycnopodia helianthoides_ will show no resistance and progress through disease signs to death.
2. _Pisaster ochraceus_ will demonstrate some resistance, and some may recover or show no signs of disease.
3. _Dermasterias imbricata_ will demonstrate complete resistance and not progress through disease signs to death.

### Experimental Design
